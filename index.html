          <p>I am a ever growing Software Developer based here in the mid-west</p>
          <p>I truly enjoy solving problems as well as creating and designing different things. I am constantly aiming to learn new things because I believe knowledge is power!
          In my free time I love to build project cars, make music, and build new websites and other code based programs.</p>

              <h2>I am a programmer</h2>
              <p>
                Although I am fairly new to programming, I am picking up pretty nicely so far.
                Im am currently perfecting my craft working with Front-end using Javascript as a standalone product
                and my next step is to Learn some frameworks like Angular for example. As a touch to my creative side I
                extremely enjoy making the website pretty using CSS, here shortly I plan to
                learn SASS as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for the back-end I have worked with NodeJS and MongoDB a tad bit but
                I will require more practice with them. I am also interested in some php frameworks
                such as Wordpress.

            <li>
              <h2>I am a artist</h2>
              <p>
                I love embracing my creative side wether its graphic design, music, or fashion
                I enjoy creating. I feel comfortable working with a few Adobe products such
                Photoshop, premiere, lightroom, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Branding, brochures, videos, User interfaces, etc... User experience
                is very important to me!
